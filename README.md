# CustomActionSheet
CustomActionSheet for iPhone and iPad using UIPresentationController and UIPopoverPresentationController

This project is intended to mimic UIAlertController for ActionSheet style. May be in future, I will try to add custom AlertView too.

All you need to do is drag in LCHActionViewController and customize your action sheet. This is a work in progress and not a polished one.

Feel free to add your customization.
